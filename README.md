# Attendance Time Calculation(APIResponseBased)

This project integrates with a third-party API that provides user time and location data. It retrieves the data, processes it, and stores it in a database for further analysis and record-keeping.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `composer install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Configure your database connection in the `.env` file.
5. Run `php artisan migrate` to create the necessary database tables.
6. (Optional) Run `php artisan db:seed` to seed the database with sample data.
7. Start the development server by running `php artisan serve`.

## Configuration

To configure the project, you need to set up the following:

- Third-Party API: Update the URL of the third-party API in the `APIResponseUserTimeLocation()` method of the `ApiResponseController` class.

- Office IP Addresses and Locations: Use the provided routes to manage office IP addresses and their corresponding locations. This information is used to determine whether a user is in the office or remote based on their IP address.

## Usage

1. Access the `/response` route to trigger the retrieval and processing of data from the third-party API.
2. The data will be processed and stored in the database.
3. Access the `/records/all` route to view the stored attendance records.
